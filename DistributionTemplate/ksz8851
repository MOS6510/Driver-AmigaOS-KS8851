# $VER: Amiga1200+ ksz8851 1.0 (04.01.2020)
#
# Configuration for the Amiga 1200+ build-in Ethernet chip ("ksz8851").

# The device name is mandatory
device=ksz8851.device

# If not provided, unit number 0 will be used. You may
# have to change this if there are multiple cards of the
# same type installed in your machine, or if your network
# hardware supports several independent connections
unit=0

# You must either pick a fixed (static) IPv4 address and
# a corresponding subnet mask, or request DHCP (dynamic)
# network address configuration.
# You can combine address/netmask/dhcp, which has the effect
# of asking the DHCP server to assign the requested IPv4
# address and subnet mask to this interface, if possible.
#address=192.168.0.1
#netmask=255.255.255.0
configure=dhcp

# If no DHCP server is present in your network, you can
# use automatic interface IPv4 address assignment through
# the ZeroConf protocol. Note that this will not set up
# default route and DNS servers for you, only the interface
# address is configured.
#configure=auto

# This variant of automatic IPv4 address assignment should
# be used in a wireless network instead of 'configure=auto'
#configure=fastauto

# You can enable diagnostic messages which can be helpful in
# tracking down configuration errors.
#debug=yes

# You can choose how much memory will be used when handling
# incoming and outgoing network traffic for this device.
# The default is to reserve 32 buffers of 1500 byte each, both
# inbound and outbound traffic. Larger values may provide
# better performance.
#iprequests=32
#writerequests=32

# For diagnostic and monitoring purposes it can be helpful to
# capture network traffic that flows through this interface.
# To enable this option, select one of filter=local,
# filter=ipandarp or filter=everything
#filter=local
#filter=ipandarp
#filter=everything

# This option disables a workaround required for the Ariadne
# network hardware, which, if enabled, would otherwise cause
# the interface setup procedure to take longer than really
# necessary.
requiresinitdelay=yes
